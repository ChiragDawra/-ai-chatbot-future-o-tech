## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
The AI models might be too large for free tier. Use lightweight version:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Edit the service
3. Change **Build Command** to: `pip install -r requirements-light.txt`
4. Redeploy

### If App Crashes:
1. Check the logs in Render dashboard
2. The app will run in basic mode without AI models
3. Still fully functional with FAQ responses
