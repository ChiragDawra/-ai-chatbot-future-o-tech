# üêô GitHub Repository Setup

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, follow these steps to create your GitHub repository manually:

## Method 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:

   - **Description**: `AI-powered chatbot for Future-O-Tech event using natural language processing and machine learning`
   - **Visibility**: Public ‚úÖ
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/chiragdawra/Desktop/Ai ChatBot"

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-chatbot-future-o-tech.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Method 2: Install GitHub CLI (Optional)

If you want to use the automated script:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
